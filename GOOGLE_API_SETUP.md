# Google API Import Error Resolution

## Problem
The AI Resume Matcher was encountering an import error:
```
Import "google.auth.transport.requests" could not be resolved
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because the required Google API client libraries were not fully installed. While `google-auth` was in requirements.txt, the specific packages `google-auth-oauthlib` and `google-api-python-client` were missing.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Requirements
Added missing Google API dependencies to `requirements.txt`:
- `google-auth-oauthlib`
- `google-api-python-client`

### 2. Improved Import Handling
Enhanced the import error handling in `modules/ai_resume_matcher_unified.py`:
- Added proper `ImportError` handling instead of generic `Exception`
- Added availability flags (`GOOGLE_API_AVAILABLE`, `PYDRIVE2_AVAILABLE`)
- Improved error messages and graceful degradation
- Moved the `Request` import inside the function to avoid import-time errors

### 3. Installation Script
Created `install_dependencies.py` to automatically install the required packages.

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Run the Installation Script
```bash
python install_dependencies.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation
```bash
pip install google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client
```

### Option 3: Update from Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## What This Fixes
- Resolves the import error for `google.auth.transport.requests`
- Ensures Google Drive functionality works properly
- Provides graceful fallback when Google libraries aren't available
- Improves error reporting and user experience

## Verification
After installation, the import error should be resolved and the AI Resume Matcher should work without Google API-related warnings.
