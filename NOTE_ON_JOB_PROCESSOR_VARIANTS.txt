Note on Job Processor Variants
==============================

This project contains multiple variants of job processor modules. To avoid confusion, please note the following:

- The active and primary implementation of the JobProcessor class is located in `modules/job_processor_Original.py`.
- Other variants such as `job_processor_fixed.py`, `job_processor_WorkingWithMTBError.py`, and `job_processor.py` are either deprecated, experimental, or serve as redirects.
- For any modifications or extensions to job processing functionality, please update `job_processor_Original.py` unless a specific variant is intended for a distinct purpose.

This note is intended to ensure clarity and maintainability of the codebase.
